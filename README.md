# Discord-Webhook-Access
Easily access and post to a webhook using a GUI.

![GUI](https://github.com/rajawilliams/Discord-Webhook-Access/blob/master/AAW.PNG?raw=true)

## How do you use this?
Paste a webhook URL into the correct field and fill out the username and content fields. Pressing send will send a request to the webhook with the required information.

## Why is this closed source?
Eventually I will make this open source, however if you really need to look at the code simply decompile it using a class viewer or something of that nature.

*Anything you do with this is not my fault; it's yours.*
